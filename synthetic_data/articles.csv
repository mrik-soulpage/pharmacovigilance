94,40070515,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Warfarin for Treatment of Chronic Disease,"This economic evaluation assessed the cost-effectiveness of Warfarin compared to standard therapy for chronic disease management. A Markov model was constructed using published efficacy data and local cost data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. Warfarin demonstrated an ICER of $45,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of results. Warfarin represents good value for money in this indication.",Brown M; Brown S; Davis J; Smith J; Jones M,Brown M,Internal Medicine,2025,2025-09-14,,10.9725/0w3s3cv72r,Brown M et al.

96,40598650,Pharmacokinetic Study of Metformin in Rat Models,"The pharmacokinetic properties of Metformin were evaluated in male Wistar rats (n=24). Animals received single doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg via oral gavage. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points over 24 hours. Plasma concentrations were measured using HPLC-MS/MS. The mean Cmax, Tmax, and AUC values were determined. The elimination half-life was approximately 4.2 hours. These preclinical data support further development of Metformin.",Williams M; Johnson E; Miller J; Jones D; Williams D,Williams M,Drug Safety,2025,2025-05-03,PMC7716927,10.2323/0x8y9m6dr9,Williams M et al.
